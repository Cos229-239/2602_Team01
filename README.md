# Class Project Template

Start here. Keep this README updated with your team name, members, and a short plan.

Team Name - Team 1 Campus 
Team Member(s) - Daniel Wetenkamp
Plan - I'll be creating an app using Android Studio and writing in Kotlin Multiplatform. The app will be a digital file cabinet of sort, but I want to make it highly customizeable by the user. It's to help keep all sorts of documents (pdfs), information, and even pictures saved in one place. For example: PDF of home, roof, HVAC system warranties; yr/mk/mdl of car(s) with oil weight, tire type/size, reminders for oil changes/maintenance; either pictures of or user-added info of their preferred company regarding HVAC/Mechanic/Lawncare/etc.
